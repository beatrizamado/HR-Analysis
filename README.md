*MACHINE LEARNING*

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Machine Learning (Unsupervised): the project follows a CRISP approach: a data-driven methodology to uncover new opportunities for expanding the business while being better equipped to target existing customers groups. We segmented the customers of Spice Alley restaurant through clustering algorithms. Identifying the main customers segments allows Spice Alley a better understanding of it's customers needs and behaviors. Essentialy, we answered the following *questions* (for more info. read the .pdf report on the "m-unsupervised_learning" folder):

    - What are our customers segments? 
    - Which features allows us to distinguish our customers and their consumption behavior?
    - What patterns/tendencies better allow us to segment our customers? 

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Machine Learning (Supervised): the project aims to predict if customers will respond positively or negatively to Spice Alley's new product campaign, based on the analysis of the customer value, behavior, channel preference and demographics. We applied supervised machine learning models such as *Neural Network, **Support Vector Machines* and *Logistic Regression*. These models were trained using the historical data obtained from Spice Alley. The predictions were obtained based on the new customer data got from the answers to the new product campaing.  


*PYTHON*

1 - Python *Assigment*: 

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/c5f015.png) 1.1. Python basics: Explore core building blocks of programming, focusing on variables, data structures, and their manipulation;

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/c5f015.png) 1.2. K-Means from scratch: Build an unsupervised learning algorithm step by step.

2 - *Webscrapping Project*: the projectâ€™s background goal is to collect the prices of the 25 items included in the Food Baskets: Operational Program to Support the Neediest People. We got the data of grocery products information with 16866 observations and eight features from 2 Portuguese supermarkets. By finding the best bargains among retailers, our analysis can assist customers in saving money. We divided the project into 3 major parts (to see the interesting conclusions check the .docx report (you have to download it) on the python folder):

    2.1. Data Collection;
    2.2. Data Cleaning;
    2.3. Data Visualization and Analysis.

*T-SQL*

The project consist of analyzing the Adventure Works database (for more info. see the "auction_script.sql" and "report.pdf" on t-sql folder).
